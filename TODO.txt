CSS:
1. Look into walking dog animation - coordinate better animations that the walking would be so quick
2. Check if keyframes need autoprefixers.


HTML / CSS

1. Text / container informing about levels.
2. Sound Effects
3. Buttons (f) fullscreen, (m) mute (not working) and (p) pause (not working)


JS:

1. Dog still laughing or with duck at end of game
2. Dog with duck when hit above 1st level not showing
4. Save records in table score;
5. Not overlaping dog with duck and dog laughing

I think itÂ´s JS not CSS problem:

- Birds falling where they are hit;
- Dog jumping when player clicks play

Abort:

- Dog walking back when hits the other side of screen;


-----------------------


Implement if we have time:

1.	Sound effects
2.	Btns: a) mute / unmute, c) pause
